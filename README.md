You're gonna do
What I tell you
You live under my roof
Follow my rules
Don't speak
Unless you're spoken to
This whole room
Don't need to know you

I fucking hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom

It'd be better if
You wore makeup
But not too much
Like a whore they fuck
Wear more this
But don't wear that
That's too much black
Eating makes you fat

I fucking hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom

If he bullies you
It means he likes you
You should say thank you
12-year-olds like you
Are too young to know abuse
Why can't you just fuck boys like a normal girl would?

I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
Oh, I hate my mom (I hate my mom)
I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom (I hate my mom)
I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom (I hate my mom)
I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom (I hate my mom)
I hate my mother fucking mom

I hate my mom.
