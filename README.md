Shearing your fealings with someone, when you are on the verge of deaht bring some 
sort or comfort to you humans it's an instinct yo help
minimize you fear and sorrow but in reality its imposible to know the 
emotions, Empaty is a simply a meaningless human delusion...so tell me
What is a hearth?.
