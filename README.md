If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinking 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinking 'bout it
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinking 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinking 'bout it

Won't you give that shit a rest?
Said you needed love, but you're only here for sex
And I'm dyin' to be next
Killed me once before
I just come back more obsessed with you
Nothing that I need to say
That hasn't been said
I don't need an apology
Just show me instead

If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinking 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinking 'bout it (won't stop thinking 'bout it)
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinking 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinking 'bout it

If you think I'm pretty, pre—, pre—, hands on, ha—, ha—
Know you ca—
If you, if you, prеtty, pre—, pre—
If you think I'm pretty, pre—, pre—, hands on, ha—, ha—
Know you ca—
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me (hehehe)
