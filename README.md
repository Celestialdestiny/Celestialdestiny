Oh, father tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Oh we get what we deserve

And way down we go, go, go, go, go
Way down we go, go, go, go, go
So way down we go, go, go, go
Way down we go

Oh, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all 
Oh, go down
Yeah but for the fall oh, my
Do you dare to look him right in the eyes? 
Yeah

Because they will run you down
Down till the dark
Yes and they will run you down
Down till you fall
And they will run you down
Down till you go
Yeah so you can't crawl no more

And way down we go, go, go, go, go
Way down we go, go, go, go, go
So way down we go, go, go, go
Because they will run you down
Down till you fall
Oh, way down we go
